# CIF introduction
CIF (Coding is Fun) is a nonprofit organization which provides free coding classes to anyone interested in coding in Python, Javascript, Markdown, and many other languages.

Lesson groups are split into three levels: beginner, junior, and senior.

For junior class, we will be creating a myriad of projects (which will be uploaded on Github) and we will write articles on Medium (find Jessica Chen).

# Project 1
We are working on our first project, a number guessing game in Python. In this project, we explore the following:
- Random library (randint function)
- using loops creatively to incorporate different variables and functions
- brainstorming ideas to improve gameplay
- creating flowcharts to help with the game layout

You can see my process of creating the game in my folders Week 2 and Week 3. We will be working on many different projects throughout the junior course, so stay tuned for any updates!
